# Higgs-Kibble-string-mapping
A python code for mapping monopole-antimonpole pairs and strings in randomized Higgs field configurations using the Kibble Mechanism.
The code has been accelerated using the JIT(Just-In-Time compiler) decorators by NUMBA.
This can be almost trivially accomplished, as in the functions in the scripts here, by restricting the functions being called to numpy functions and using static arrays inside the desired routine.

## Example of a code that finds the monopole-antimonopole pair and tracks the string connecting them.
