This is a set of scripts to study the magnetic field structure of a randomly generated
monopole-string distribution as in 'random_gen'.
The task is to create a zoom in analysis using the topological
quantities that dictate the location of the monopoles as a guide.
Will continue to use the zombie scripts since I haven't cleaned the functions 
to compute topological quantities in julia; specifically 'tetrahedra_2' that takes care of 
tessalating the cubic lattice into a tetrahedral lattice
