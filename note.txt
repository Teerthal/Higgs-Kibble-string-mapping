Succeded in working out moving the moonpole along the string
added in on-the-fly computing of tet charges and phases on plaquettes to track movement of monopoles and strings.
added in break and continue statements so transformation ends when there is no string when one is expected

need to do:
add in the phase shift so string goes away after moving the monopole
need to  figure out moving the monopole in the tet with the antimonopole
